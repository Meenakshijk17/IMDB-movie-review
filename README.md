## Aim
* To predict whether a review is positive and negative
    * Preprocess text data
    * Perform TF-IDF vectorization
    * Explore hyperparameters using GridSearchCV on Random Forest & Gradient Boosting.

## Data

It provides a set of 12,500 highly polar movie reviews for training and 12,500 for testing. Please see http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ for more information on the dataset.
